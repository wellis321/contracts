Excellent questions! This gets to the heart of how the social care market actually works in Scotland. Let me search for information about commissioning and procurement processes.Brilliant questions - these get to the heart of how the system actually works! The answers are complex and reveal why the sector is pushing for reform.

## Do Organizations Bid for Work?

**YES** - but it depends on the type and value of contract. There are multiple routes to market:

### 1. **Competitive Tendering** (Traditional approach)
- Local authorities advertise contracts
- Multiple providers submit bids
- Contracts awarded based on price AND quality (cannot be price alone since 2016)
- **However**: In practice, tight budgets often mean price becomes the dominant factor

### 2. **Framework Agreements**
- Pre-qualified list of approved providers
- Providers bid to get onto the framework
- Local authorities can then "call off" from the framework without re-tendering each time
- **Example**: Scotland Excel Care and Support Framework (2024-2030) has 152 providers

### 3. **Direct Awards**
- For individual placements where service user chooses specific provider
- Under SDS Option 1, people can choose any provider
- No competitive process needed

### 4. **Spot Purchasing**
- Emergency or urgent placements
- Negotiated rates, often higher

### 5. **Block Contracts**
- Authority buys set capacity (e.g., 100 hours/week)
- Negotiated or tendered

## Do Rates Vary Across Scotland?

**YES - SIGNIFICANTLY**. Despite the national minimum worker pay (£12.60/hour), what local authorities actually **pay providers** varies enormously:

### Why Rates Differ:

**1. No National Framework for Provider Rates**
- Worker minimum: £12.60/hour (mandated)
- Homecare Association recommended minimum: £32.88/hour to providers
- **Actual LA rates**: Somewhere in between, varies by authority

**2. Each Local Authority Sets Own Rates** based on:
- Their budget constraints
- Local cost of living
- Historic contracts
- Political priorities
- Commissioning strategy

**3. Different Contract Types Get Different Rates**:
- Framework agreements
- Individually negotiated contracts
- Spot purchases (usually higher)
- Block contracts
- SDS direct payments

**4. Service Type Variations**:
- Care at home
- Supported living
- Residential care
- Specialist services (e.g., dementia, learning disabilities)

### Example Differences:
- Edinburgh charges service users £23.94/hour for non-personal care
- Glasgow has different rates
- Rural authorities may pay more due to travel distances
- Some authorities pay flat rates for sleepovers, others pay hourly

## If Rates Are Set, Why Tender?

**This is the key question!** And it reveals the problems with the current system:

### What Organizations ARE Competing On:

**1. **Quality Scores****
- Staff training
- Experience
- Care Inspectorate ratings
- Policies and procedures
- Innovation

**2. Price** (despite guidance)
- Even though contracts must consider quality AND price
- Tight budgets mean lowest price often wins
- This undercuts quality

**3. Capacity**
- Geographic coverage
- Availability
- Specialist skills
- Language skills

**4. Added Value / Community Benefits**
- Employment opportunities
- Training placements
- Local sourcing
- Environmental commitments

### The Problem:

The Feeley Review (2021 Independent Review of Adult Social Care) found that competitive tendering driven by price is **undermining the sector**:

> "We want to see an end to the emphasis on price and competition and to see the establishment of a more collaborative, participative and ethical commissioning framework"

### Why This Happens:

1. **Local authority budgets are squeezed**
2. **Social care demand is rising**
3. **Price becomes dominant factor** despite rules against it
4. **Providers compete by cutting costs** (often staff terms/conditions)
5. **Quality suffers**
6. **Staff leave sector** for better-paid retail/hospitality jobs
7. **Cycle continues**

### Real-World Example:
Homecare Association research found **only 1% of homecare contracts** with public bodies pay rates that enable:
- Compliance with National Living Wage
- Financial sustainability
- Quality care delivery

## The Procurement Process - Where Is It Laid Out?

### Key Legislation:

**1. Public Contracts (Scotland) Regulations 2015**
- "Light-touch regime" for social care over £663,540
- More flexible than standard procurement

**2. Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014**
- Sustainable procurement duty
- Community benefits requirements
- Fair Work considerations
- Contracts £50,000-£663,540

**3. Social Care (Self-directed Support) (Scotland) Act 2013**
- Requirement to offer choice
- LA must ensure range of providers (Section 19)

**4. Public Bodies (Joint Working) (Scotland) Act 2014**
- Integration Joint Boards create Strategic Commissioning Plans
- But can't hold contracts themselves (LA/Health Board do)

### The Process:

```
1. STRATEGIC COMMISSIONING PLAN
   ↓
   (What services are needed?)
   
2. NEEDS ASSESSMENT
   ↓
   (How much capacity required?)
   
3. MARKET ENGAGEMENT
   ↓
   (Talk to providers about what's possible)
   
4. PROCUREMENT ROUTE DECISION
   ├─ Tender (open/restricted/negotiated)
   ├─ Framework call-off
   ├─ Direct award (if justified)
   └─ Dynamic Purchasing System
   
5. EVALUATION CRITERIA
   ├─ Quality (must be considered)
   ├─ Price (cannot be sole factor)
   └─ Social value/community benefits
   
6. CONTRACT AWARD
   ↓
7. MONITORING & REVIEW
```

### Where to Find It:

**Government guidance**:
- "Procurement of care and support services: best practice guidance" (updated 2021)
- "Procurement Reform (Scotland) Act 2014: statutory guidance"
- Published on gov.scot

**Advertising platforms**:
- Public Contracts Scotland (www.publiccontractsscotland.gov.uk) - main portal
- Scotland Excel - for framework agreements
- Individual LA websites

## Do The Rules Change?

**YES - And they're changing RIGHT NOW**:

### Recent/Current Changes:

**1. Move Away from Competitive Tendering**
- Feeley Review (2021) recommendations
- Push for "ethical commissioning"
- Collaborative not competitive approaches
- **Status**: Policy direction set, implementation patchy

**2. National Care Service Bill (in progress)**
- Would standardize commissioning
- Set national ethical commissioning requirements
- **Status**: Going through Parliament, Stage 2 starting Feb 2025

**3. Fair Work Requirements** (strengthening)
- Living Wage compliance
- Union recognition
- Secure contracts
- **Status**: Gradual implementation

**4. SDS Framework of Standards** (2024)
- 13 standards for SDS delivery
- Affects how LAs commission
- **Status**: Being rolled out

### Why Rules Keep Changing:

1. **System isn't working**:
   - Providers going bust
   - Staff recruitment crisis
   - Quality concerns
   - Unmet need rising

2. **Legal changes**:
   - Brexit (EU procurement rules no longer apply post-2020)
   - Scottish legislation evolving
   - Case law on employment rights

3. **Political pressure**:
   - Workforce campaigns
   - Provider organization lobbying (CCPS)
   - Independent reviews
   - Public concern

### What's Stable:

- Need for transparency
- Fair work principles
- Cannot discriminate
- Must consider quality not just price
- Community benefit requirements
