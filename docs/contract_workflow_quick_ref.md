## The 3 Main Benefits

### 1️⃣ **Never Miss Deadlines**
⏰ See contracts ending in next 6 months
🔴 Red alert if < 90 days
🟠 Orange warning if < 180 days

**Example:**
Instead of: "Oh no! Contract ends next month!"
You get: "Contract ends in 5 months - time to start extension talks"

---

### 2️⃣ **See Your Sales Pipeline**
📊 Track tender opportunities like a sales dashboard

```
Market Engagement (2)  →  Potential new business
Tender Submitted (4)   →  Waiting for decision  
Under Evaluation (1)   →  Being reviewed
Awarded (2)           →  Won! Need to start
Lost (1)              →  Didn't win
```

**Example:**
Instead of: "I think we bid on something in Aberdeen?"
You get: "We have £600k in tenders pending decision across 5 local authorities"

---

### 3️⃣ **Organize Your Work**
🎯 Everything grouped by priority and stage

**Top of page** = What needs attention NOW (expiring soon)
**Grouped sections** = What's at each workflow stage
**Yellow warnings** = Data quality issues to fix

**Example:**
Instead of: "Let me dig through 50 contracts to see what needs doing"
You get: "3 things need my attention today (highlighted in red/orange)"

---

## The 11 Tender Statuses Explained

Think of it like a job application process:

1. **Market Engagement** = Heard about the job, initial chat
2. **Pre-Qualification** = Submitting your CV/application
3. **Tender Submitted** = Full application sent, waiting
4. **Under Evaluation** = They're reviewing your application
5. **Clarification Requested** = They have questions
6. **Awarded** = You got the job! 🎉
7. **Lost** = Someone else got it
8. **Contract Live** = You're working there now
9. **Extension Negotiation** = Discussing staying longer
10. **Retender Pending** = Contract ending, reapplying needed
11. **Contract Ended** = No longer working there

**You don't need to use all of them** - just the ones that apply to your situation.

## Common Questions

### Q: "I have 50 contracts - isn't this overwhelming?"
**A:** No! The page **organizes** them so you only see what matters:
- Most will be "Contract Live" (just running normally)
- You only focus on what needs action (expiring, under evaluation, etc.)

### Q: "Do I need to update statuses constantly?"
**A:** No! Only when things change:
- Submit a tender → Set to "Tender Submitted"
- Win a contract → Set to "Awarded" then "Contract Live"
- Contract nearing end → Set to "Extension Negotiation" or "Retender Pending"

### Q: "What if I don't know the tender status?"
**A:** Use these simple defaults:
- Active contracts → "Contract Live"
- Submitted tenders → "Tender Submitted"
- Ending contracts → "Extension Negotiation"

## Key Takeaway

The Contract Workflow page is like **Netflix for your contracts**:

- 🎬 **Netflix:** Organizes movies by genre, "Continue Watching", "Trending"
- 📋 **Workflow Page:** Organizes contracts by status, "Expiring Soon", "Under Evaluation"

Just as Netflix makes it easy to find what to watch, the Workflow page makes it easy to find what contracts need your attention.

**Instead of a chaotic mess, you get an organized dashboard that saves you 7+ hours per week and prevents contract crises.**

1. **Visit:** http://localhost:8888/contract-workflow.php
2. **Review:** "Expiring Soon" section (are any red?)
3. **Update:** Set statuses on contracts (if missing)
4. **Bookmark:** For quick access
5. **Check:** Weekly (or daily if actively bidding tenders)

**That's it! You're now managing contracts like a pro.** 🎯
